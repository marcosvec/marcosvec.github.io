## Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Open `interactive-room.html` in a web browser
2. Use mouse to navigate around the room
3. Hover over objects for information
4. Click on drawers and doors to interact

### Controls
- **Mouse drag**: Look around
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Graphics preset**: Change quality settings
- **Measure mode**: Click two points to measure distance
- **Exploded view**: Toggle furniture part separation
- **GLB Models**: Switch between procedural and GLB models

### Model Integration
To use your Siemens NX ‚Üí Blender ‚Üí GLB models:

1. Place GLB files in a `models/` directory
2. Update `FURNITURE_CONFIG` in `model-loader.js`
3. Enable GLB models using the toggle button
4. Models will load dynamically with fallback to procedural
